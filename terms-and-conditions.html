            <p><strong>Voss Digital Ltd</strong></p>

        </div>

        <h2>1. APPLICATION OF TERMS</h2>
        <p>These Terms & Conditions apply to all goods and/or services commissioned by the Client (Person, Company, Partnership, Organisation or body) from Voss Digital Ltd (hereinafter "the Company") by form of an on-screen, printed or verbal order. Where the Company has presented the Client with a digital or printed proposal, this becomes the order, covering the scope of the commission, deadlines, fees payable etc.</p>
        <p>In the event that these standard Terms & Conditions do not meet the Client's requirements, the Company can offer tailored Terms and Conditions as drafted by a specialised law firm, for which all costs will be met by the Client.</p>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to modify these Terms & Conditions at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version on the website (vossdigital.co.uk). Continued use of services after such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</p>

        <h2>2. ACCEPTANCE OF CONDITIONS</h2>
        <p>By placing a commission with the Company, you confirm acceptance of these Terms & Conditions, which will remain valid indefinitely until officially terminated by written request and mutually agreed by both parties and subject to payment in full of all outstanding invoices and contractual agreements. Terms & Conditions stipulated on the Client's Order Form shall be regarded as void if they conflict with these Terms & Conditions.</p>

        <h2>3. HOURS OF BUSINESS</h2>
        <p>The Company agrees to provide the services outlined during normal business hours of Monday to Friday, 9:00am – 5:00pm. No provision or agreement has been made or offered to provide services outside of these hours unless by prior arrangement.</p>

        <h2>4. INVOICES AND PAYMENT</h2>
        <p>Full payment of the total invoice is due within 30 days of the date of invoice, unless otherwise agreed in writing. A 1.5% monthly service charge is payable on all overdue invoices. Payments will be credited first to late payment charges and next to the unpaid balance.</p>
        <p>Whilst any payment due under the agreement remains outstanding, the Company shall be entitled at sole and absolute discretion to withhold provision of any goods or services otherwise obliged to be provided under the agreement.</p>
        <p>All payments by cheque, banker's draft or money order must be made in pounds sterling and made payable to Voss Digital Ltd.</p>
        <p>For Client charges that attribute an exchange rate, the Company reserves the right to amend fees to incorporate both the latest rate and any related credit card charges (factoring fee).</p>

        <h2>5. EXPENSES AND ADDITIONAL COSTS</h2>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to charge expenses and additional costs arising from additions, substantive changes and amendments to designs and development code made by the Client to the original order, on top of any previously agreed fee, after two sets of amendments.</p>
        <p>Any additional changes after two sets of amendments will be charged at the hourly rate of £75 per hour (minimum charge of 1 hour applies).</p>
        <p>For website launches, once a website has gone live, any subsequent change requests will be charged at the hourly rate of £75 per hour (minimum charge of 1 hour applies).</p>
        <p>System issues that arise after the first calendar month of a website going live will also be charged at the hourly rate of £75 per hour (minimum charge of 1 hour applies). These can also be covered by an agreed Maintenance Contract (which are subject, in turn, to their own Terms & Conditions).</p>

        <h2>6. TIMING</h2>
        <p>The Company will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to perform the services within the deadlines agreed within the commission but cannot be held responsible for any loss or damages resulting from the Client's delay at any stage of the commission.</p>

        <h2>7. CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>

            <li>Proof reading: In the event the Client approves the commission but errors such as, but not limited to, typographic errors or misspellings remain in the finished product, the Client shall be charged the full amount of the commission and incur any additional costs of correcting such errors.</li>
            <li>Any data provided by the Client must meet industry standards and comply with the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. The Company will not be liable for any data provided which doesn't meet industry standards or comply with applicable data protection legislation.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>11.4 Professional Standards</h3>
